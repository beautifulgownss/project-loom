# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots for the main README.md file.

## Required Screenshots

The following screenshots are referenced in the main README and should be added here:

1. **dashboard.png** - Main dashboard overview showing follow-up jobs and quick stats
2. **composer.png** - Email composer with AI generation and brand voice selection

6. **voice-studio.png** - Brand voice management interface

## Screenshot Guidelines

When adding screenshots:

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Size**: Maximum width 1200px for optimal GitHub rendering
- **Quality**: High quality, but compressed for reasonable file sizes
- **Content**: Use realistic but anonymized data
- **Theme**: Show both light and dark mode versions if applicable
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `email-preview.png`)

## Placeholder Status

Currently, these are placeholder references. Actual screenshots will be added once the application UI is finalized.

To take screenshots:
1. Run the application locally
2. Navigate to each feature
3. Take high-quality screenshots
4. Optimize/compress images
5. Add them to this directory with the correct filenames
6. Commit and push to the repository

The main README will automatically display them once they're added here.
