# Voice Studio - Executive Summary

## üéØ What Is Voice Studio?

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision

### ‚úÖ Integrated Module (Chosen Approach)

**Build Voice Studio within existing Next.js app as a separate route group.**

**Why?**
- Seamless UX (no app switching)
- Instant brand availability in Outreach
- Shared auth, database, components
- Faster development
- Lower costs

**Not building as separate app because:**
- Adds complexity for data sync
- Requires duplicate auth
- Slows feature development
- Increases operational overhead
- We're not at scale requiring separation (1M+ users)

---

## üìä Database Schema

**5 new tables:**

1. **`brands`** - Brand voice profiles
   - voice_profile JSON (8 attributes)
   - do_use/dont_use arrays
   - examples array

2. **`personas`** - Buyer personas
   - Demographics, psychographics
   - Pain points, goals, motivations
   - Content preferences, buying journey

3. **`content_topics`** - Generated topic ideas
   - Title, description, category
   - Relevance score
   - Keywords, estimated engagement

4. **`voice_checks`** - Consistency analysis history
   - Content text
   - Overall score + breakdown
   - Suggested edits

5. **`brand_examples`** - Example content library
   - Title, content type
